        <h2>What is it?</h2>

        <p>
          The Southern Societé of Computational Libationists <i>(est. 1718)</i>
          sponsors a weekly gathering for nerds of all colors, creeds,
          lingiustic allegiances, and stylistic dogmas. It's an aggressively
          unstructured way to hack amongst peers, converse about
          the vagaries of this or that methodology of developmental arts, or
          simply to partake of delicious libations in delightful company.
        </p>

        <h2>When and Where?</h2>

        <p>
          Our soireé happens
          <strong> every week, on Tuesday, at 7pm! </strong>
          We're generously sponsored by
          <strong>LaunchPad,</strong>
          a fine co-working space located at 
          <strong>643 Magazine St.</strong> To gain entry, you must enter the
          secret knock, which is any knock on the big glass window on
          Capdeville St.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You'll also find a number of us either inside or outside of
          <strong>Capdeville,</strong>
          a purveyor of fine libations located just next door.
          </p>

        <h2>It's my first time! What can I expect?</h2>

        <p>
          Naught but merriment, hacking, and chatter! 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There's no agenda, no presentations, no requirements, and hackers and
          the hacker-curious of all levels are welcome to attend.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If you're just joining us, one of our fine greeters will be happy to
          introduce you to like-minded wizards of analytical enginery, or
          non-like minded, for the more pugnacious of you. Just walk up to one
          of these fine fellows and be greeted, and 
          <strong>
            your first libation is on us!
          </strong>
